What is web fuzzing? | A testing technique that sends various types of user input to a web interface to study how it reacts and discover hidden directories, files, and parameters
What does ffuf stand for? | Fuzz Faster U Fool
What HTTP status code indicates a page exists? | HTTP 200 OK
What HTTP status code indicates a page does not exist? | HTTP 404 Page Not Found
What is the purpose of using wordlists in web fuzzing? | To provide commonly used terms for directories, files, and parameters instead of manually testing random inputs
Where can you find comprehensive wordlists for web fuzzing? | In the SecLists repository on GitHub, available under /opt/useful/SecLists on PwnBox
What is the difference between directory fuzzing and file fuzzing? | Directory fuzzing searches for existing directories/folders, while file fuzzing searches for specific files with extensions
What does the FUZZ keyword represent in ffuf? | A placeholder that gets replaced with each word from the wordlist during scanning
Why is extension fuzzing important before file fuzzing? | To identify what file extensions the web server uses (like .php, .html, .aspx) so you know what to search for
What is recursive fuzzing? | Automatically scanning subdirectories found during the initial scan to create a complete directory tree
What is the main advantage of recursive scanning? | It automates the process of scanning multiple directory levels instead of manually fuzzing each discovered directory
What is the difference between sub-domains and VHosts? | Sub-domains have public DNS records, while VHosts are served on the same IP and may not have public DNS records
How does VHost fuzzing work? | By modifying the Host header in HTTP requests to test for virtual hosts on the same IP address
What is the key difference between GET and POST parameter fuzzing? | GET parameters are passed in the URL after a question mark, while POST parameters are sent in the HTTP request body
Why might you need to create custom wordlists for value fuzzing? | Because parameter values are often specific to the application (like sequential IDs) and may not exist in pre-made wordlists
What is the purpose of filtering results in ffuf? | To remove false positives and focus on meaningful results by filtering out responses with specific status codes, sizes, or word counts
Why do you need to add domains to /etc/hosts when fuzzing local targets? | Because browsers and tools need to resolve domain names to IP addresses, and local/private domains don't have public DNS records
What does a response size filter help accomplish in VHost fuzzing? | It filters out the default responses that all invalid VHosts return, leaving only legitimate VHost discoveries
How can you identify if a discovered parameter is deprecated? | The server response will typically indicate the method or parameter is no longer in use
What information can help you determine the correct file extension to fuzz? | Server type from HTTP headers (Apache suggests .php, IIS suggests .asp/.aspx) or by fuzzing common extensions first
