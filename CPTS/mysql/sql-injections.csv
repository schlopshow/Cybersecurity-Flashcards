What is sanitization in the context of SQL injections?|The removal of special characters in user-input to break any injection attempts
What happens when an application misinterprets user input as actual code?|Injection occurs, changing the code flow and executing the injected code instead of treating it as a string
What causes a SQL injection vulnerability?|When user input is passed directly to SQL queries without proper sanitization or filtering
What are the three main categories of SQL injections based on output retrieval?|In-band (Union Based and Error Based), Blind (Boolean Based and Time Based), and Out-of-band
What is In-band SQL injection?|When the output of both intended and injected queries is printed directly on the front end
What is Blind SQL injection?|When output is not directly visible, so SQL logic is used to retrieve information character by character
What is Out-of-band SQL injection?|When there's no direct access to output, so results must be directed to a remote location like DNS records
Why does injecting a single quote often cause SQL syntax errors?|It creates an odd number of quotes in the query, breaking the SQL syntax structure
What SQL operator can be used to make authentication bypass conditions always return true?|The OR operator, using conditions like '1'='1' that are always true
How does operator precedence affect SQL injection with AND and OR?|AND is evaluated before OR, so 'username=admin OR 1=1 AND password=wrong' will still return true
What are the two types of line comments in MySQL?|Double dash with space (-- ) and hash symbol (#)
Why must there be a space after -- in SQL comments?|Two dashes alone are not sufficient to start a comment in SQL; there must be an empty space after them
What is the purpose of the UNION clause in SQL?|To combine results from multiple SELECT statements into a single result set
What is the main requirement for UNION statements to work?|All SELECT statements must have the same number of columns with matching data types
How can you handle uneven columns when using UNION injection?|Fill extra columns with junk data like numbers or strings, or use NULL which fits all data types
What are the two methods to detect the number of columns in a table for UNION injection?|Using ORDER BY with incrementing column numbers, or using UNION with different column counts
Why is it important to identify which columns are displayed on the webpage?|Because injected queries will only show results if placed in columns that are actually rendered to the user
What is the benefit of using numbers as junk data in UNION injections?|Numbers make it easy to track which columns are printed and help identify where to place the actual injection
How can you test if a column displays output in UNION injection?|Use a recognizable query like @@version in place of a number to see if it gets displayed
What makes a web application vulnerable to SQL injection?|Direct incorporation of user input into SQL queries without proper input validation or parameterized queries
