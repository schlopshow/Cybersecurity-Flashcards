What is SQL injection (SQLi)?|A vulnerability that occurs when malicious users pass input that changes the final SQL query sent by a web application to the database enabling them to perform unintended SQL queries directly against the database
What are the three main steps an attacker must perform to execute a SQL injection?|1. Inject SQL code outside expected user input limits 2. Subvert web application logic by changing the original query or executing a new one 3. Retrieve the new query's output through the web application's front end
What characters are commonly used to escape user input limits in SQL injection?|Single quote (') or double quote (") to escape the limits of user input and inject data directly into the SQL query
What is a DBMS?|Database Management System - helps create define host and manage databases
Name the five essential features of a DBMS|Concurrency Consistency Security Reliability and Structured Query Language (SQL)
What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?|Relational databases use tables rows columns and schemas with SQL while non-relational (NoSQL) databases use various storage models without fixed structure and don't use SQL
What are the four common storage models for NoSQL databases?|Key-Value Document-Based Wide-Column and Graph
What is a schema in relational databases?|A template that dictates the data structure stored in the database and defines relationships between tables
What is a primary key?|A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table
What does the AUTO_INCREMENT property do?|Automatically increments the value by one every time a new item is added to the table
What does the NOT NULL constraint ensure?|That a particular column is never left empty making it a required field
What does the UNIQUE constraint do?|Ensures that inserted items are always unique preventing duplicate values in that column
What is the purpose of the DEFAULT keyword?|Specifies a default value for a column when no value is provided during insertion
What does the asterisk (*) symbol represent in SQL SELECT statements?|A wildcard that selects all columns from the specified table
What is the purpose of the WHERE clause?|To filter or search for specific data by applying conditions to SELECT UPDATE or DELETE statements
What does the LIKE clause enable?|Selecting records by matching a certain pattern using wildcards like % and _
What does the % wildcard match in LIKE clauses?|Zero or more characters after the specified pattern
What does the _ wildcard match in LIKE clauses?|Exactly one character
What are the three main logical operators in SQL?|AND OR and NOT (can also be represented as && || and !)
What is the result of an AND operation?|True only if both conditions evaluate to true
What is the result of an OR operation?|True if at least one condition evaluates to true
What does the NOT operator do?|Toggles a boolean value converting true to false and vice versa
What is operator precedence in SQL?|The order in which operations are evaluated with division/multiplication first then addition/subtraction then comparison then NOT then AND then OR
What are some potential impacts of SQL injection attacks?|Retrieving sensitive information like passwords bypassing login authentication accessing admin panels reading/writing files on the server and potentially gaining control of the entire system
What is the main difference between SQL injection and NoSQL injection?|SQL injections target relational databases using SQL while NoSQL injections target non-relational databases and use completely different methods
What is a three-tier architecture in web applications?|Tier I (client applications) Tier II (middleware/application server) and Tier III (DBMS) where data flows from client through middleware to database
Why might databases be hosted separately from application servers?|To improve performance and scalability especially for databases with large amounts of data supporting many users
