What is a shell in computing context? | The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Examples include Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.

What is a shell in exploitation and security context? | A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host, such as triggering EternalBlue on a Windows host to gain cmd-prompt access remotely.

What is a web shell? | A web shell exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host through a browser window.

What is a command language interpreter? | A program that interprets instructions provided by the user and issues tasks to the operating system for processing, working in combination with the OS and terminal emulator application.

What is a bind shell? | A shell where the target system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).

What are the main challenges with bind shells? | There must be a listener already started on the target, admins configure strict incoming firewall rules, and OS firewalls will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted applications.

What is a reverse shell? | A shell where the attack box has a listener running, and the target initiates the connection back to the attacker.

Why are reverse shells often preferred over bind shells? | Because admins are more likely to overlook outbound connections, giving a better chance of going undetected, whereas bind shells rely on incoming connections that are more likely to be blocked by firewalls.

What is Netcat and why is it useful for shells? | Netcat (nc) is considered a Swiss-Army Knife tool that can function over TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets, capable of using IPv4 & IPv6, opening and listening on sockets, and operating as a proxy.

What command starts a basic Netcat listener? | nc -lvnp [port number]

What is the payload for establishing a basic bind shell with Netcat on Linux? | rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l [IP] [port] > /tmp/f

Why might attackers use common ports like 443 for reverse shells? | Because it's rare to see security teams blocking common ports like 443 (HTTPS) outbound, since many applications rely on these ports for legitimate business purposes.

What is a major obstacle when using PowerShell reverse shells on Windows? | Windows Defender antivirus software often blocks malicious PowerShell scripts, requiring AV to be disabled or bypassed.

What does "living off the land" mean in the context of shells? | Using tools and applications that are already native to the target system rather than transferring external tools, making the attack less detectable.

What PowerShell command can disable Windows Defender real-time monitoring? | Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

In a reverse shell setup, which system acts as the server and which as the client? | The attack box acts as the server (running the listener), and the target system acts as the client (initiating the connection).

What are some methods that might be used to deliver a reverse shell payload to a target? | Unrestricted File Upload, Command Injection, or other exploitation techniques that allow code execution on the target system.

Why might deep packet inspection firewalls still detect reverse shells on common ports? | Because they examine the contents of network packets, not just IP addresses and ports, so they can detect malicious traffic even on legitimate ports.

What is the difference between a basic Netcat connection and a proper shell? | A basic Netcat connection only allows text to be passed between client and server, while a proper shell allows interaction with the OS and file system.

What should you consider when asking "What applications and shell languages are hosted on the target?" | This helps determine what native tools can be used to establish a reverse shell without transferring additional binaries to the target system.
