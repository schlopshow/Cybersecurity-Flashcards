What does CVSS stand for? | Common Vulnerability Scoring System
What is CVSS? | An industry standard for calculating severity ratings of vulnerabilities
What does DREAD stand for in Microsoft's risk assessment system? | Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability
What scale does DREAD use to assess security threats? | A scale of 10 points
What are the two main components of CVSS scoring? | Exploitability and impact of an issue
What does the CIA triad stand for? | Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
What are the four Exploitability Metrics in CVSS? | Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction
What does Confidentiality Impact measure? | The impact on securing information and ensuring only authorized individuals have access
What does Integrity Impact measure? | The impact on information not being changed or tampered with to maintain accuracy
What does Availability Impact measure? | The impact on having information readily attainable for business requirements
What are the three main metric groups in CVSS? | Base Metric Group, Temporal Metric Group, Environmental Metric Group
What does the Base Metric Group represent? | The vulnerability characteristics consisting of exploitability metrics and impact metrics
What does the Temporal Metric Group detail? | The availability of exploits or patches regarding the issue
What does the Environmental Metric Group represent? | The significance of the vulnerability of an organization, taking into account the CIA triad
What are the five values for Exploit Code Maturity? | Not Defined, High, Functional, Proof-of-Concept, Unproven
What does a 'High' value mean for Exploit Code Maturity? | An exploit consistently working for the issue and is easily identifiable with automated tools
What are the five values for Remediation Level? | Not Defined, Unavailable, Workaround, Temporary Fix, Official Fix
What does 'Workaround' mean in Remediation Level? | An unofficial solution released until an official patch by the vendor
What are the four values for Report Confidence? | Not Defined, Confirmed, Reasonable, Unknown
What does 'Confirmed' mean in Report Confidence? | There are various sources with detailed information confirming the vulnerability
What do Modified Base Metrics represent? | Metrics that can be altered if the affected organization deems a more significant risk in CIA triad elements
What are the four values for Modified Base Metrics? | Not Defined, High, Medium, Low
What was the CVSS Base Metrics score for the Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability example? | 8.8
What organization provides a public CVSS calculator? | National Vulnerability Database
