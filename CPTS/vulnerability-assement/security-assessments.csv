What is the primary purpose of security assessments? | To find and confirm vulnerabilities are present so they can be patched, mitigated, or removed
What is a vulnerability assessment based on? | A particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (going through a checklist)
What factors determine which security standards apply to a network? | Industry-specific and regional data security regulations, company size and network form, types of applications used or developed, and security maturity level
What is a penetration test? | A type of simulated cyber attack where testers conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible
What is the key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack? | A pentest is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested
What is black box pentesting? | Done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications, typically from the perspective of an external attacker
What is grey box pentesting? | Done with a little bit of knowledge of the network, from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in IT
What is white box pentesting? | Conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, and source code
What do application pentesters assess? | Web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications
What do network or infrastructure pentesters assess? | All aspects of a computer network, including networking devices, workstations, servers, and applications
What do physical pentesters try to leverage? | Physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to facilities
What do social engineering pentesters test? | Human beings - whether employees can be fooled by phishing, vishing, or other scams
What type of organizations is pentesting most appropriate for? | Organizations with a medium or high security maturity level
What is security maturity? | How well developed a company's cybersecurity program is - it takes years to build and involves hiring knowledgeable professionals, having well-designed policies, and strong security culture
Why might organizations with lower security maturity focus on vulnerability assessments instead of pentests? | A pentest could find too many vulnerabilities to be useful and could overwhelm staff tasked with remediation
What does a vulnerability assessment involve during validation? | Running a vulnerability scan and performing validation on critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities to show evidence they exist and are not false positives
What is the difference between vulnerability assessments and penetration tests in terms of approach? | Vulnerability assessments look for vulnerabilities without simulating cyber attacks and go through a checklist, while penetration tests are simulated cyber attacks to see if and how the network can be penetrated
What are security audits? | Requirements from outside the organization, typically mandated by government agencies or industry associations to assure compliance with specific security regulations
What is PCI-DSS? | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - a regulation enforced by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council for companies that accept credit and debit card payments
What are bug bounty programs? | Programs that invite members of the general public to find security vulnerabilities in applications, with restrictions like no automated scanning
What type of companies are appropriate for bug bounty programs? | Larger companies with large customer bases and high security maturity that can dedicate a team to triaging bug reports
What is a red team assessment? | A type of evasive black box pentesting that simulates cyber attacks from an external threat actor perspective, typically with an end goal
How does red team assessment reporting differ from penetration testing? | Red teams only report vulnerabilities that led to completion of the goal, not as many vulnerabilities as possible like in penetration tests
What is a blue team? | Defensive security specialists who often work in a SOC or CSIRT and may have digital forensics experience
What is a purple team? | Formed when offensive and defensive security specialists work together to improve network security - red teams find problems and blue teams learn and fix them
What is a purple team assessment? | Like a red team assessment but the blue team is involved at every step and may play a role in designing campaigns
What should organizations do before considering penetration testing? | Have a track record of vulnerability assessments and actions taken in response to vulnerability assessments
When might an organization benefit more from vulnerability assessments over penetration tests? | When they want to receive a view of commonly known issues monthly or quarterly from a third-party vendor
When might an organization benefit more from penetration tests over vulnerability assessments? | When looking for an approach that uses manual and automated techniques to identify issues outside of what a vulnerability scanner would find
What is important for organizations that receive annual or semi-annual penetration testing? | They should still regularly evaluate their environment with internal vulnerability scans to identify new vulnerabilities as they are released
What is the aim of a Vulnerability Assessment? | To identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment
Is there manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment? | There is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment
What does a vulnerability assessment provide besides identifying risks? | Remediation steps to fix the issues
What is the purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment? | To understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access
What might customers ask for regarding vulnerability validation? | Some may ask to validate as many vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to confirm scanner findings and rule out false positives
Why is it essential to clarify scope before starting a vulnerability assessment? | Different customers may want different approaches - some want validation of findings, others want a report of all scanner findings
What should organizations always do before pushing substantial patches? | Test substantial patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions
What is a Vulnerability? | A weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors
Where can vulnerabilities be registered and how are they scored? | Through MITRE's Common Vulnerability Exposure database and receive a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to determine severity
What is the CVSS score range? | Scores can range from 0 to 10, depending on various metrics
What metrics are used to calculate CVSS scores? | Type of attack vector (network, adjacent, local, physical), attack complexity, privileges required, whether attack requires user interaction, and impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
What is the relationship between Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk? | Threat plus Vulnerability equals Risk - a threat is a new incident with potential harm, a vulnerability is a known weakness, risk is the potential damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability
What is a Threat? | A process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability
What factors make some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns? | The probability of the vulnerability being exploited - higher reward outcome and ease of exploitation make it more likely to be exploited
What is an Exploit? | Any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness
Where can exploits be found? | Open-source platforms such as Exploit-db, Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database, GitHub, and GitLab
What is Risk? | The possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors
How does ISO 31000 define risk? | Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives - an effect can be positive (opportunity) or negative (threat)
How can you differentiate Risk, Threat, and Vulnerabilities? | Risk: something bad that could happen, Threat: something bad that is happening, Vulnerabilities: weaknesses that could lead to a threat
What factors determine the level of risk in weaknesses? | Likelihood and impact - vulnerabilities with reliable exploit code likely to be used significantly raise the risk level
What should organizations start with when planning their cybersecurity strategy? | Creating an inventory of their data assets - you must know what you are protecting
What is Asset Inventory? | A critical component of vulnerability management where an organization understands what assets are in its network to provide proper protection and set up appropriate defenses
What types of assets should be included in asset inventory? | Information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets
What should assets have to ensure adequate security? | Data classifications to ensure adequate security and access controls
What are the main categories of data assets for inventory? | All data stored on-premises, all data storage that cloud providers possess, all data stored within SaaS applications, all applications needed for business operations, all on-premises computer networking devices
What types of on-premises data storage should be inventoried? | HDDs and SSDs in endpoints and servers, external drives, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards), and legacy technology like floppy disks and tape drives
What are some popular cloud providers mentioned? | Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure
What is a multi-cloud environment? | Corporate networks that have more than one cloud provider
What are examples of SaaS applications that store data? | Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Apple iCloud, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Google Docs
What types of on-premises networking devices should be inventoried? | Routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, dedicated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), data loss prevention (DLP) systems
What must be done when data assets are added or removed? | This must be thoroughly noted in the data asset inventory
What are the 8 steps to perform a network vulnerability assessment? | 1. Conduct risk identification and analysis, 2. Develop scanning policies, 3. Identify scan types, 4. Configure the scan, 5. Perform the scan, 6. Evaluate risks, 7. Interpret results, 8. Create a remediation plan
