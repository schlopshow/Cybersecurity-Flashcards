Why should administrative/superuser accounts never be used with web applications? | They have excessive privileges that could lead to server compromise if exploited
What is the purpose of parameterized queries? | They use placeholders for input data which is then safely escaped by drivers
How can you determine what database you're currently connected to? | SELECT database()
What are common queries to find the current database user? | SELECT USER() or SELECT CURRENT_USER()
Where are MySQL global variables stored in INFORMATION_SCHEMA? | global_variables table
What is SQL injection?|A vulnerability where malicious users can inject SQL code into web application queries to execute unintended database operations
What are the three main steps an attacker needs for SQL injection?|1. Inject SQL code outside expected input limits 2. Execute a different SQL query 3. Retrieve the output from the new query

What is a DBMS?|Database Management System - software that helps create, define, host, and manage databases
What are the main features of a DBMS?|Concurrency, Consistency, Security, Reliability, and Structured Query Language support
What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?|Relational databases use tables, rows, columns and schemas with SQL; Non-relational (NoSQL) databases use various storage models without fixed schemas
What does RDBMS stand for?|Relational Database Management System
What is a database schema?|The structure that defines the relationships between tables within a database
What are the four common NoSQL storage models?|Key-Value, Document-Based, Wide-Column, and Graph
What is a primary key?|A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table
What does the AUTO_INCREMENT property do?|Automatically increments a column value by one every time a new record is added
What does the NOT NULL constraint ensure?|That a particular column is never left empty - it's a required field
What does the UNIQUE constraint do?|Ensures that all values in a column are different - no duplicates allowed
What does the DEFAULT keyword specify?|The default value to use for a column if no value is provided during insertion
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?|WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY operations
What does the LIKE operator do?|Enables pattern matching in queries using wildcards like % and _
What does the % wildcard match?|Zero or more characters in a LIKE pattern
What does the _ wildcard match?|Exactly one character in a LIKE pattern
What are the three main logical operators in SQL?|AND, OR, and NOT
What is operator precedence in SQL?|The order in which operations are evaluated in complex expressions
What does ORDER BY do?|Sorts query results by specified columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order
What does LIMIT do?|Restricts the number of records returned by a query
What is the purpose of the OFFSET in LIMIT?|Specifies how many records to skip before starting to return results
What are the main SQL statement categories?|DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DCL (Data Control Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language)
What is the impact of SQL injection on web applications?|Can lead to unauthorized data access, bypassing authentication, reading/writing files, and potentially gaining server control
What are some prevention methods for SQL injection?|Input sanitization and validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, proper user privileges
What is the difference between SQL injection and NoSQL injection?|SQL injection targets relational databases using SQL; NoSQL injection targets non-relational databases with different query methods
What is a three-tier architecture in database systems?|Client applications (Tier 1), Application server/middleware (Tier 2), Database server (Tier 3)
What port does MySQL typically run on?|Port 3306
What does a table represent in a relational database?|A collection of related data organized in rows and columns
What is the purpose of data types in database columns?|Define what kind of values can be stored in each column (numbers, strings, dates, etc.)
What happens if you try to insert data longer than a VARCHAR limit?|An error occurs as the data exceeds the column's defined maximum length
What is the difference between DDL and DML?|DDL defines database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP); DML manipulates data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
What is database normalization?|The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
What are foreign keys?|Columns that reference the primary key of another table to establish relationships
What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?|INNER JOIN returns only matching records from both tables; LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table plus matches from the right
What is a database index?|A data structure that improves query performance by creating shortcuts to data locations
What are database transactions?|A sequence of operations that are treated as a single unit of work - either all succeed or all fail
What does ACID stand for in database terms?|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - properties that guarantee reliable database transactions
What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?|CHAR has fixed length and pads with spaces; VARCHAR has variable length and uses only needed space
What are views in databases?|Virtual tables created from query results that don't store data but provide a way to present data
What is database denormalization?|The process of adding redundancy to improve query performance at the cost of storage space
What are stored procedures?|Precompiled SQL code blocks stored in the database that can be executed multiple times
What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?|Clustered indexes physically reorder table data; non-clustered indexes create separate structures pointing to data
What is a composite key?|A primary key composed of multiple columns that together uniquely identify a record
What are database triggers?|Special stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain database events
What is connection pooling?|A technique that maintains a cache of database connections to improve application performance
What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?|DELETE removes specific rows and can be rolled back; TRUNCATE removes all rows, is faster, but cannot be rolled back
What is SQL injection?|SQL injection occurs when user input is inputted into an SQL query string without properly sanitizing or filtering the input allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL code
What is sanitization in the context of SQL injection?|Sanitization refers to the removal of any special characters in user-input in order to break any injection attempts
What are the three main categories of SQL injection based on output retrieval?|In-band (Union-based and Error-based) Blind (Boolean-based and Time-based) and Out-of-band SQL injection
What is In-band SQL injection?|SQL injection where the output of both intended and injected queries may be printed directly on the front end allowing direct reading of results
What is Blind SQL injection?|SQL injection where output is not directly visible requiring the use of SQL logic to retrieve information character by character using conditional statements
What is Out-of-band SQL injection?|SQL injection where there is no direct access to output requiring directing results to a remote location like DNS records for retrieval
What SQL operator can be used to make authentication bypass conditions always return true?|The OR operator can be used because if at least one condition is TRUE the entire query evaluates to TRUE
Why does the condition '1'='1' work for SQL injection bypass?|Because 1 always equals 1 making this condition always evaluate to TRUE regardless of other conditions in the query
What are the two types of line comments available in MySQL for SQL injection?|Two dashes with a space (-- ) and the hash symbol (#)
What is the purpose of using comments in SQL injection?|Comments allow attackers to ignore or comment out parts of the original query to avoid syntax errors and control query execution
What is the UNION clause used for in SQL?|UNION is used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements allowing data extraction from multiple tables and databases
What is a key requirement for UNION statements to work?|UNION statements can only operate on SELECT statements with an equal number of columns
How do you handle uneven columns in UNION injection?|Use junk data like numbers or strings to fill remaining columns so the total number of columns matches the original query
What are two methods to detect the number of columns in a table for UNION injection?|Using ORDER BY to sort by column numbers until an error occurs or using UNION with different column numbers until success
Why is it important to determine which columns are displayed in UNION injection?|Not all columns from a query may be displayed on the webpage so injection must be placed in visible columns to see output
What happens when SQL injection causes a syntax error?|The application typically returns an error message indicating the query failed due to improper SQL syntax
What is operator precedence important in SQL injection?|The AND operator is evaluated before OR operator so understanding precedence helps craft successful injection payloads
How can parentheses affect SQL injection attempts?|Parentheses group conditions and may require closing them properly or the injection will cause syntax errors
What is Union-based SQL injection?|A type of in-band SQL injection that uses the UNION operator to combine malicious queries with legitimate ones to extract data
What is Error-based SQL injection?|A type of in-band SQL injection that intentionally causes SQL errors to return information about the database structure or data
