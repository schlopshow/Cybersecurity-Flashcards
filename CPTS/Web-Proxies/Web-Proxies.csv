What are web proxies and how do they function?|Web proxies are specialized tools that act as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools between browsers/mobile applications and back-end servers to capture and view all web requests being sent between both ends
What ports do web proxies typically work with?|Web proxies mainly work with web ports such as HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443
What are the main uses of web proxies beyond capturing HTTP requests?|Web application vulnerability scanning, web fuzzing, web crawling, web application mapping, web request analysis, web configuration testing, and code reviews
What is Burp Suite and what are its key characteristics?|Burp Suite is the most common web proxy for web penetration testing with an excellent user interface and built-in Chromium browser. It has both free community and paid pro/enterprise versions
What are some paid-only features of Burp Suite Pro?|Active web app scanner, fast Burp Intruder, and the ability to load certain Burp Extensions
What is OWASP ZAP and how does it differ from Burp Suite?|ZAP is a free and open-source web proxy tool initiated by OWASP with no paid-only features. It provides similar functionality to Burp but without throttling or subscription limitations
What is the main advantage of ZAP over Burp Suite?|ZAP is completely free and open-source with no throttling or limitations in scans, and it's gaining many paid-only Burp features for free
When might you choose to intercept HTTP responses?|When you want to change how a specific web page looks, like enabling disabled fields or showing hidden fields, which may help in penetration testing activities
What is automatic modification in web proxies?|The ability to apply certain modifications to all outgoing HTTP requests or incoming HTTP responses automatically based on rules you set
What is Match and Replace in Burp Suite?|A feature that allows you to match any text within requests or responses (header or body) and replace them with different text automatically
What is the Replacer feature in ZAP?|ZAP's equivalent to Burp's Match and Replace, allowing automatic replacement of request/response content based on defined rules
Why is URL encoding important in web requests?|It ensures request data is properly formatted and headers are correctly set. Key characters like spaces, &, and # need encoding to avoid server errors
What types of encoding do web proxies typically support?|HTML, Unicode, Base64, ASCII hex, and various URL encoding formats
What is Burp Intruder and what is its main limitation in the free version?|Burp's web fuzzer for fuzzing pages, directories, parameters, etc. The free version is throttled to 1 request per second, making it extremely slow
What are the four main attack types in Burp Intruder?|Sniper (single position), Battering Ram, Pitchfork, and Cluster Bomb (the text mentions Sniper and Cluster Bomb specifically)
What are payload positions in Burp Intruder?|The points where words from your wordlist will be placed and iterated over, marked with ยง symbols
What is the difference between Simple List and Runtime file payload types?|Simple List loads the entire wordlist in advance, while Runtime file loads line-by-line as the scan runs to avoid excessive memory usage
What is Payload Processing in Burp Intruder?|A feature that allows you to determine fuzzing rules over the loaded wordlist, such as adding extensions or filtering based on specific criteria
What is proxychains and how is it useful for web proxying?|A Linux tool that routes all traffic from any command-line tool through a specified proxy, making it the simplest method to route CLI tool traffic through web proxies
What is the Target Scope in Burp Suite?|A feature that defines a custom set of targets to be processed by Burp features, allowing you to include/exclude specific URLs from scans
What is the difference between Crawl and Crawl and Audit in Burp Scanner?|Crawl only navigates and maps the website by following links, while Crawl and Audit performs both crawling and vulnerability scanning
What is a Passive Vulnerability Scan?|A scan that analyzes the source of already visited pages without sending new requests, looking for potential vulnerabilities like missing HTML tags or DOM-based XSS
What is an Active Vulnerability Scan?|A comprehensive scan that runs crawling, web fuzzing, passive scanning, JavaScript analysis, and fuzzes various parameters to look for common vulnerabilities
What does ZAP Spider do?|Similar to Burp Crawler, it spiders websites by looking for links and validating them to build a comprehensive site map
What is Ajax Spider in ZAP?|A specialized spider that identifies links requested through JavaScript AJAX requests that may be running on pages after they load
What is the difference between page alerts and overall alerts in ZAP HUD?|Page alerts show issues identified in the current page you're visiting, while overall alerts show issues found across the entire web application
What are BApp Store extensions in Burp Suite?|Community-developed extensions that add specific functionality to Burp, with some available to all users and others requiring Pro licenses
What is ZAP Marketplace?|ZAP's extensibility feature that allows installation of community-developed add-ons, with releases in different build stages (Release, Beta, Alpha)
What are some key differences between network sniffing tools like Wireshark and web proxies?|Network sniffing tools analyze all local network traffic, while web proxies focus specifically on web ports and HTTP/HTTPS traffic
Why might you want to proxy tools like nmap or Metasploit through web proxies?|To gain transparency into the web requests made by these tools and utilize proxy features for analysis and modification of their traffic
What is the Show/Enable feature in ZAP HUD?|A feature that can automatically enable disabled input fields or show hidden input fields without needing to intercept responses or refresh pages
