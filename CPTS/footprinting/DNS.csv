"What is DNS?","Domain Name System - a system for resolving computer names into IP addresses without a central database"
"How many DNS root servers are there globally?","13 root servers around the globe"
"What organization coordinates the work of DNS root name servers?","ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)"
"What is the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative name servers?","Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone and their information is binding. Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone and collect information using recursive or iterative DNS querying"
"What are the main DNS encryption solutions mentioned?","DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH), and DNSCrypt"
"What does an A record return?","Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain"
"What does an AAAA record return?","Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain"
"What does an MX record return?","Returns the responsible mail servers"
"What does an NS record return?","Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain"
"What can a TXT record contain?","Various information including Google Search Console validation, SSL certificate validation, SPF and DMARC entries for mail traffic validation"
"What is a CNAME record used for?","Serves as an alias for another domain name"
"What does a PTR record do?","Works in reverse - converts IP addresses into valid domain names (reverse lookup)"
"What information does an SOA record provide?","Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact"
"What are the three types of DNS configuration files?","Local DNS configuration files, zone files, and reverse name resolution files"
"What is the most commonly used DNS server on Linux distributions?","Bind9"
"What are the main Bind9 configuration files?","named.conf.local, named.conf.options, named.conf.log"
"What is a zone file?","A text file that describes a DNS zone with the BIND file format - it's a point of delegation in the DNS tree"
"What must every zone file contain?","Precisely one SOA record and at least one NS record"
"What is the purpose of reverse name resolution files?","To resolve IP addresses to Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) using PTR records"
"What does the allow-query option define?","Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server"
"What does the allow-recursion option define?","Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server"
"What does the allow-transfer option define?","Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server"
"What command is used to query DNS NS records?","dig ns domain.com @dns-server"
"What command can be used to query DNS server version?","dig CH TXT version.bind dns-server-ip"
"What command shows all available DNS records?","dig any domain.com @dns-server"
"What does AXFR stand for?","Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone"
"What port is typically used for DNS zone transfers?","TCP port 53"
"What command performs a zone transfer?","dig axfr domain.com @dns-server"
"What is the difference between a master and slave DNS server?","A master serves as a direct source for synchronizing a zone file, while a slave obtains zone data from a master"
"What is a primary DNS server?","The DNS server where the original data of a zone is located - always a master"
"What is a secondary DNS server?","Additional servers installed to increase reliability and load distribution - can be both slave and master"
"What tool can be used for DNS subdomain brute forcing?","DNSenum"
"What is the refresh time for DNS slaves to check SOA records?","Usually one hour"
"What happens when a DNS slave's SOA serial number is lower than the master's?","The data sets no longer match and synchronization is needed"
"What security risk does unencrypted DNS pose?","Devices on local WLAN and Internet providers can intercept and spy on DNS queries"
"What is the purpose of the rndc-key?","A secret key that ensures DNS servers communicate with their own master or slave"
