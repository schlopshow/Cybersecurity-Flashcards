What is IPMI? | Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring.
What are the three primary uses of IPMI? | 1) Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings, 2) When the host is fully powered down, 3) Access to a host after a system failure.
What does IPMI monitor? | IPMI can monitor system temperature, voltage, fan status, power supplies, inventory information, hardware logs, and alerting using SNMP.
What is the default communication port for IPMI? | IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP.
What is a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)? | A BMC is a micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI that manages the host's hardware.
Name three common BMCs found during penetration tests. | HP iLO, Dell DRAC, Supermicro IPMI.
What command is used to scan for IPMI version using Nmap? | sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 [target]
What are the default credentials for Dell iDRAC? | Username: root, Password: calvin.
What is a significant flaw in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0? | The server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication, allowing the password hash to be obtained.
What command can be used to crack IPMI password hashes using Hashcat? | hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u.
What is the purpose of the Metasploit module auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes? | It retrieves IPMI 2.0 RAKP Remote SHA1 Password Hashes.
What is the risk associated with IPMI in network environments? | Exposing password hashes can lead to unauthorized access, system disruption, and even remote code execution.
What is the cleartext password for the user ADMIN in the example provided? | ADMIN.
What is the significance of checking for IPMI during penetration tests? | It can lead to high-risk findings and unauthorized access to critical systems.
