# flashcards
This is respository of my anki flashcards for various cybersecurity certifications I am taking. The flashcard format is Question | Answer. I delimit using a pipe instead of a comma in CSV files because some of the cards contain commas in the answer portion and will mess up formatting in anki.

The flashcards I am currently working on are CPTS and CBBH. I will also be starting work on interview questions for blue and read team as flashcards for the comptia examinations.

All the flashcards are made either using AI, and then modified by me, or written directly from me parphrasing notes. I try not to copy information presented in the certifications line by line but rather just a general description of what needs to be known or understood.
