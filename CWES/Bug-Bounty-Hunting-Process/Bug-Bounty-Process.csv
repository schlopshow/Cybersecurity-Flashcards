What is a bug bounty program? | A crowdsourcing initiative and continuous proactive security testing that supplements internal code audits and penetration tests, completing an organization's vulnerability management strategy
What are the two main types of bug bounty programs? | Private (invitation-only) and Public (accessible by entire hacking community)
What is the difference between a Bug Bounty Program (BBP) and a Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)? | VDP only provides guidance on how to report vulnerabilities; BBP incentivizes discovery and reporting with monetary rewards
What factors determine invitations to private bug bounty programs? | Track record, valid finding consistency, and violation record of the bug bounty hunter
What is a Parent/Child bug bounty program? | Programs where a bounty pool and single cyber security team are shared between a parent company and its subsidiaries
What are the essential elements of a good bug report? | Vulnerability Title, CWE & CVSS score, Vulnerability Description, Proof of Concept (POC), Impact, and Remediation (optional)
What does CWE stand for and what is it? | Common Weaknesses Enumeration - a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types serving as common language for security tools
What does CVSS stand for and what is it used for? | Common Vulnerability Scoring System - a published standard used worldwide to communicate the severity of vulnerabilities
What are the four Attack Vector options in CVSS? | Network (N) - remotely exploitable, Adjacent (A) - same network, Local (L) - local/SSH access, Physical (P) - physical manipulation
What are the two Attack Complexity levels in CVSS? | Low (L) - no special preparations needed, High (H) - special preparations and information gathering required
What are the three Privileges Required levels in CVSS? | None (N) - no special access, Low (L) - standard user privileges, High (H) - admin-level privileges
What are the two User Interaction options in CVSS? | None (N) - attacker can exploit independently, Required (R) - user action needed before exploitation
What are the two Scope options in CVSS? | Unchanged (U) - affects only vulnerable component, Changed (C) - can affect other components beyond the vulnerable one
What are the three impact levels for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability in CVSS? | None (N) - no impact, Low (L) - some loss/limited control, High (H) - total loss/complete control
What should you do after submitting a bug report? | Do not interact immediately; allow the security/triage team time to process, validate, and respond according to their SLAs
How should you communicate with the security/triage team? | Remain professional, tag the specific team member handling your submission, use only official communication channels, stay calm
What should you do if there's a disagreement about severity or bounty? | Explain your CVSS rationale, review the program policy and scope for compliance, contact mediation if needed
Why is the violation record important for bug bounty hunters? | It's always considered for invitations to private programs and affects your reputation in the community
What is the recommended approach when reading bug bounty program policies? | Read meticulously including code of conduct to meet expectations and avoid time-wasting back-and-forth communications
What makes a bug report title effective? | Should include vulnerability type, affected domain/parameter/endpoint, and impact information
