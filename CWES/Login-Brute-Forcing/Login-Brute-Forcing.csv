What is brute forcing in cybersecurity? | A trial-and-error method used to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found
What factors determine the success of a brute force attack? | Password complexity, computational power available to the attacker, and security measures in place like account lockouts and CAPTCHAs
What is a simple brute force attack? | Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set and length range with no prior information about the password
What is a dictionary attack? | Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords rather than trying all possible combinations
When is a dictionary attack most effective? | When the target is likely to use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns
What is a hybrid attack? | Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks, often appending or prepending characters to dictionary words
What is credential stuffing? | Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services, assuming users reuse passwords
What is password spraying? | Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames to avoid account lockout policies
What is a rainbow table attack? | Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords quickly
What is reverse brute force? | Targets a single password against multiple usernames, often used with credential stuffing attacks
What is distributed brute force? | Distributes the brute forcing workload across multiple computers to accelerate the process
What are the NIST guidelines for strong passwords? | Minimum 12 characters length, complexity with mixed character types, uniqueness across accounts, and randomness avoiding dictionary words
What makes default credentials dangerous? | They are pre-set, simple, easily guessable passwords that come with devices and services, making them prime targets for attackers
How do you calculate possible password combinations? | Character Set Size raised to the power of Password Length (Character Set Size^Password Length)
What is the exponential relationship in password complexity? | Each additional character or character type dramatically increases the number of possible combinations and cracking time
What is Basic HTTP Authentication? | A challenge-response protocol where a server demands user credentials, which are Base64 encoded and sent in the Authorization header
What is the format for Basic Auth credentials? | Username and password concatenated with a colon, then Base64 encoded as "Basic <encoded_credentials>"
What are login forms in web applications? | HTML forms with input fields for username and password that send POST requests to authentication endpoints
What is the difference between failure and success conditions in brute force tools? | Failure conditions check for error messages indicating failed login, while success conditions look for indicators of successful authentication like redirects or specific content
What is Hydra? | A fast network login cracker that supports numerous attack protocols and can brute-force various services using parallel connections
What is Medusa? | A fast, massively parallel, and modular login brute-forcer designed to support various services that allow remote authentication
What makes custom wordlists more effective than generic ones? | They are tailored to specific targets using gathered intelligence like personal information, company details, and social media data
What is Username Anarchy? | A tool that generates comprehensive username lists from names, accounting for initials, common substitutions, and various naming conventions
What is CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler)? | A tool that creates highly personalized password wordlists based on target intelligence like birthdays, pet names, interests, and relationships
Why do password policies sometimes lead to predictable patterns? | Users often make minor modifications like appending numbers or special characters when forced to change passwords
What information sources are valuable for custom wordlist creation? | Social media profiles, company websites, public records, news articles, and OSINT gathering
What is the core problem that enables credential stuffing? | Password reuse across multiple accounts, where a breach on one platform compromises numerous other accounts
What makes brute force attacks against complex passwords impractical? | The exponential growth in possible combinations makes cracking time prohibitively long even with powerful computing resources
What is the relationship between password length and security? | Each additional character dramatically increases possible combinations - a 6-character lowercase password has ~300 million combinations while an 8-character has ~200 billion
What are common password weaknesses that enable successful attacks? | Short passwords, dictionary words, personal information, password reuse, and predictable patterns like "qwerty" or simple substitutions
What is the purpose of penetration testing in relation to brute forcing? | Ethical hacking that simulates real-world attacks to identify and address authentication vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them
What security measures can defend against brute force attacks? | Account lockouts after failed attempts, CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, multi-factor authentication, and strong password policies
What is leetspeak and how does it affect password security? | Replacing letters with numbers or symbols (like j4n3 for jane), which attackers account for in their wordlists and substitution rules
