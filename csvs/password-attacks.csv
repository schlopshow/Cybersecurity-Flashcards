What are the three core principles of information security? | Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
What are the four authentication factors? | Something you know (password), Something you have (ID card/security key), Something you are (physical self/username), Somewhere you are (geolocation/IP address)
What is the most common authentication method? | Use of passwords
How many possible passwords exist for a standard 8-digit password with only uppercase letters and numbers? | 36‚Å∏ (208,827,064,576) possible passwords
According to the 2019 Google and Harris Poll survey, what percentage of Americans used passwords like 123456, qwerty, and password? | 24%
What percentage of Americans reused passwords across multiple accounts according to the 2019 survey? | 66%
What percentage of Americans used password managers in 2019 vs 2025? | 15% in 2019, 36% in 2025
What is the most common password that appeared 4.5 million times in data breaches? | 123456
What percentage of Americans would change their passwords after a data breach? | Only 45%
What is a hash function? | A mathematical function that transforms an arbitrary number of input bytes into a typically fixed-size output
What are common examples of hash functions? | MD5 and SHA-256
What is password cracking? | When attackers attempt to figure out the original password based on the hash alone
What are the three common password cracking techniques? | Rainbow tables, dictionary attacks, and brute-force attacks
What are rainbow tables? | Large pre-compiled maps of input and output values for a given hash function
What is a salt in cryptographic terms? | A random sequence of bytes added to a password before it is hashed
Why are salts effective against rainbow tables? | Because even if the correct password has been mapped, the combination of salt and password has likely not been mapped
What is a brute-force attack? | Attempting every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered
What is the only password cracking technique that is 100% effective? | Brute-force attack
What is a dictionary attack? | A wordlist attack that uses a list containing statistically likely passwords rather than attempting every possible combination
What is rockyou.txt? | A list of over 14 million real passwords that were leaked when the RockYou website was hacked in 2009
How were passwords stored on the RockYou website? | Unencrypted
What website can be used to check if an email address has been affected by data breaches? | HaveIBeenPwned
Why is brute-forcing rarely used for stronger passwords? | Because of how much time it takes, and it is typically replaced by more efficient mask attacks
What affects brute-forcing speeds? | The hashing algorithm and hardware that is used
How many passwords per second might hashcat guess when attacking MD5 vs DCC2? | Over 5 million per second for MD5, only 10,000 per second for DCC2
