What is a password policy? | A set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to create strong passwords and use them appropriately according to the organization's standards

What does the scope of a password policy include? | The entire password lifecycle including creation, storage, management, and transmission

Name three common security standards that include password policy guidelines | NIST SP800-63B, CIS Password Policy Guide, and PCI DSS

What is the current industry recommendation regarding password expiration? | The industry has shifted to recommending that password expiration be disabled as it often leads users to adopt predictable, weak patterns

What are some words that should be blacklisted in password policies? | Company name, common words associated with the company, names of months and seasons, variations of "welcome" and "password", and common passwords like "password" and "123456"

What two major components are essential for successful password policy implementation? | The definition of the password policy and its enforcement

How many passwords does the average person have according to NordPass? | Around 100 passwords

What is a password manager? | An application that securely stores passwords and sensitive information in an encrypted database

What is Zero-Knowledge Encryption in password managers? | A security approach that ensures no one, not even the service provider, can access your secured data

What are the three key components in Bitwarden's password derivation approach? | Master key (derived from master password), master password hash (for authentication), and decryption key (for decrypting vault items)

What is the main difference between cloud and local password managers? | Cloud managers synchronize across devices via cloud storage, while local managers store the database locally with user responsibility for protection

Name three popular cloud password managers | 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane (also acceptable: Keeper, LastPass, NordPass, RoboForm)

Name three popular local password managers | KeePass, KWalletManager, Pleasant Password Server (also acceptable: Password Safe)

What are common features of password managers? | 2FA support, multi-platform compatibility, browser extensions, login autocomplete, import/export capabilities, and password generation

What is passwordless authentication? | Authentication achieved using factors other than passwords, relying on possession factors (something you have) or inherent factors (something you are)

What is FIDO2? | An open authentication standard that enables passwordless logins using physical devices like YubiKey

What are the three authentication factors? | Knowledge factor (something you know), possession factor (something you have), and inherent factor (something you are)

Why are knowledge factors (passwords) vulnerable? | They are vulnerable to theft, sharing, repeat use, misuse, and other security risks

What alternatives to passwords can organizations implement? | Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), FIDO2, One-Time Passwords (OTP), Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP), IP restrictions, and device compliance enforcement

What cryptographic functions do password managers use for security? | Cryptographic hash functions and key derivation functions to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted databases

What are the requirements in the sample password policy provided? | Minimum 8 characters, include uppercase and lowercase letters, at least one number, at least one special character, cannot be the username, must be changed every 60 days

Why might password expiration policies be ineffective? | Users often make predictable changes like changing "01" to "02" at the end of passwords, creating nearly identical passwords that still comply with policy

What makes the password "Inlanefreight01!" weak despite meeting policy requirements? | It includes the company name, making it easily guessable, and follows predictable patterns that attackers are aware of

What is an example of a strong but memorable password approach? | Using ordinary words, phrases, or song lyrics like "This is my secure password" or "The name of my dog is Popy" with added special characters

What tools can help evaluate and generate strong passwords? | PasswordMonster for evaluating password strength and 1Password Password Generator for generating secure passwords

What should be considered when creating passwords based on personal information? | Attackers can use OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) to learn about individuals, so personal information should be used carefully in password creation

What encryption standard does Bitwarden use for vault decryption? | AES-256 bit encryption

What key derivation function does Bitwarden use? | PBKDF2-SHA256 algorithm

Why might local password managers use random salt in key derivation? | To prevent precomputed keys and to hinder dictionary and guessing attacks

What additional protections might local password managers offer? | Memory protection and keylogger resistance using secure desktop environments similar to Windows UAC

What platforms might a user need to consider when choosing a password manager? | Linux, Android, Chrome OS, Windows, iOS, Mac, and other operating systems for multi-platform synchronization

What is the main challenge that leads to weak password practices? | The need to manage around 100 passwords for various services, leading to password reuse and overly simple passwords

What authentication method do most operating systems and applications use by default? | Password-based authentication

What companies are advocating for a passwordless future? | Microsoft, Auth0, Okta, and Ping Identity

What is the fundamental problem with knowledge factors in authentication? | They rely on something the user knows, which is vulnerable to theft, sharing, repeat use, and misuse

What are examples of possession factors in authentication? | Physical devices like YubiKey or other hardware tokens that the user possesses

What are examples of inherent factors in authentication? | Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or other physical characteristics unique to the user

What is the purpose of browser integration in password managers? | To provide seamless login experiences through browser extensions and autocomplete functionality

Why might organizations prefer local password managers over cloud-based ones? | To maintain complete control over their security without relying on third-party services for data storage and protection
