Why should penetration tests and vulnerability assessments comply with specific standards? | To be accredited and accepted by governments and legal authorities, ensure thorough assessment in an agreed-upon manner, increase efficiency, and reduce likelihood of attack
What are the big compliance players in information security? | PCI, HIPAA, FISMA, and ISO 27001
Why are accreditations necessary for organizations? | They certify that an organization has had a third-party vendor evaluate its environment, and some companies won't do business without specific accreditations
What is PCI DSS? | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - implements requirements for organizations that handle credit cards
Is PCI DSS a government regulation? | No, while not a government regulation, organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must still implement PCI DSS guidelines
What types of organizations must implement PCI DSS? | Banks or online stores that handle their own payment solutions (e.g., Amazon)
What is a Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)? | An environment where any credit card data that is being processed or transmitted must be handled, and it must be adequately segmented from normal assets
Why are CDE environments segmented? | To protect cardholder data from being compromised during an attack and limit internal access to data
What are the PCI DSS Goals? | Build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly monitor and test networks, maintain an information security policy
What is HIPAA? | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, used to protect patients' data
Does HIPAA require vulnerability scans or assessments? | HIPAA does not necessarily require vulnerability scans or assessments, however, a risk assessment and vulnerability identification are required to maintain HIPAA accreditation
What is FISMA? | Federal Information Security Management Act - a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard government operations and information
What does FISMA require organizations to provide? | Documentation and proof of a vulnerability management program to maintain information technology systems' proper availability, confidentiality, and integrity
What is ISO 27001? | A standard used worldwide to manage information security
What does ISO 27001 require organizations to perform? | Quarterly external and internal scans
Should compliance drive a vulnerability management program? | No, vulnerability management should consider the uniqueness of an environment and the associated risk appetite to an organization
What does ISO 27001 compliance depend upon? | Maintaining an effective Information Security Management System
What must always be defined for a pentest? | A specifically defined scope and a signed legal contract with pentesters outlining what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do
How should penetration testing be conducted regarding harm? | In such a way that minimal harm is done to a company's computers and networks
What should penetration testers avoid? | Making changes wherever possible (such as changing an account password) and limit the amount of data removed from a client's network
What is an example of proving risk without removing sensitive data? | Instead of removing sensitive documents from a file share, a screenshot of the folder names should suffice to prove the risk
What is PTES? | Penetration Testing Execution Standard - can be applied to all types of penetration tests and outlines the phases of a penetration test
What are the seven sections in PTES? | Pre-engagement Interactions, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, Reporting
What is OSSTMM? | Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual - another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly
How many channels does OSSTMM have and what are they? | Five channels: Human Security, Physical Security, Wireless Communications, Telecommunications, Data Networks
What is Human Security in OSSTMM? | Human beings are subject to social engineering exploits
What does Wireless Communications include in OSSTMM? | Technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth (including but not limited to)
What is NIST known for in cybersecurity? | The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a system for designing incident response policies and procedures
What are the phases of the NIST Penetration Testing Framework? | Planning, Discovery, Attack, Reporting
What does OWASP stand for? | Open Web Application Security Project
What is OWASP typically known for? | Being the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications
What are the three main standards/guides that OWASP maintains? | Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG), Firmware Security Testing Methodology
What does WSTG stand for? | Web Security Testing Guide
What does MSTG stand for? | Mobile Security Testing Guide
