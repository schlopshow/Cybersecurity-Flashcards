What is SNMP and what was it created for? | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was created to monitor network devices and can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely
What is the current version of SNMP? | SNMPv3, which increases security but also complexity
What UDP port does SNMP use for normal operations? | UDP port 161
What UDP port does SNMP use for traps? | UDP port 162
What are SNMP traps? | Data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested, triggered by specific events
What is MIB? | Management Information Base - an independent format for storing device information in a standardized tree hierarchy
What format are MIB files written in? | Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) based ASCII text format
What is an OID? | Object Identifier - represents a node in a hierarchical namespace, uniquely identified by a sequence of numbers
What is the main security flaw of SNMPv1? | No built-in authentication mechanism and no encryption - all data is sent in plain text
What does SNMPv2c stand for? | Community-based SNMP
What security improvements does SNMPv3 offer? | Authentication using username and password, and transmission encryption via pre-shared key
What are community strings? | Passwords used to determine whether requested information can be viewed or not
What is a dangerous SNMP setting? | rwuser noauth - provides access to the full OID tree without authentication
What tool is used to query OIDs with their information? | snmpwalk
What tool can brute-force community string names? | onesixtyone
What tool can brute-force individual OIDs? | braa
What is the syntax for using braa? | braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*
What is the default community string often used? | public
Why is the transition from SNMPv2 to SNMPv3 often avoided? | The complexity increases significantly with more configuration options, and services need to remain active
What information can be gathered from SNMP enumeration? | System information, installed packages, network configuration, and other device details
