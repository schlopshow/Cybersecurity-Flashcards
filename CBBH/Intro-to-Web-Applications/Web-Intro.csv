What are web applications? | Interactive applications that run on web browsers using a client-server architecture with front-end components running on the browser and back-end components on the server
What is the difference between websites and web applications? | Websites are static and cannot be changed in real-time (Web 1.0), while web applications present dynamic content based on user interaction and are fully functional (Web 2.0)
What are the main advantages of web applications over native OS applications? | Platform independence, no installation required, version unity, easier updates and maintenance, reduced support costs
What are the four main web application infrastructure models? | Client-Server, One Server, Many Servers - One Database, Many Servers - Many Databases
What is the riskiest web application architecture model? | One Server model because if any web application is compromised, all applications and data on that server are compromised
What are the three layers of web application architecture? | Presentation Layer (UI components), Application Layer (processes requests and checks authorization), Data Layer (determines where data is stored and accessed)
What are microservices? | Independent components programmed for one specific task that communicate in a stateless manner and can be written in different programming languages
What are the benefits of microservices architecture? | Agility, flexible scaling, easy deployment, reusable code, and resilience
What is serverless architecture? | Cloud-based architecture where applications run in stateless containers without managing infrastructure, with server management handled by cloud providers
What are the three components of the front-end trinity? | HTML (structure), CSS (styling), JavaScript (functionality)
What is URL encoding and why is it necessary? | Process of replacing unsafe ASCII characters with % followed by hexadecimal digits because browsers can only use ASCII encoding in URLs
What is the DOM? | Document Object Model - a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs to access and update document content, structure, and style
What are CSS frameworks and why are they used? | Collections of CSS stylesheets and designs that make it faster and easier to create beautiful HTML elements, optimized for web applications
What is the primary purpose of JavaScript in web applications? | To control functionality and interactive elements on the front-end, making pages dynamic rather than static
What is Sensitive Data Exposure? | Vulnerability where sensitive data is available in clear-text to end users, typically found in HTML source code or comments
What is HTML Injection? | Vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on a page, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML code
What are the three main types of XSS? | Reflected XSS (input displayed after processing), Stored XSS (input stored in database), DOM XSS (input directly shown in browser DOM)
What is CSRF? | Cross-Site Request Forgery - attacks that utilize vulnerabilities to perform queries and API calls on behalf of authenticated users
What are the two main controls for preventing front-end attacks? | Sanitization (removing special characters) and Validation (ensuring input matches expected format)
What are the main components of a back-end server? | Web Server, Database, Development Framework, and the underlying hardware and OS
What are some popular web server technology stacks? | LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP), WINS (Windows, IIS, .NET, SQL Server)
What are the three most common web servers? | Apache (40% of websites), NGINX (30% of websites), IIS (15% of websites)
What is the main advantage of NGINX over Apache? | NGINX focuses on serving many concurrent requests with low memory/CPU load using async architecture
What are the two main types of databases? | Relational (SQL) databases that use tables, rows, and columns, and Non-relational (NoSQL) databases that use various storage models
What are the four NoSQL storage models? | Key-Value, Document-Based, Wide-Column, and Graph
What is the difference between SOAP and REST APIs? | SOAP uses XML for structured data transfer, while REST uses URL paths and typically returns JSON responses
What HTTP methods does REST use and for what purposes? | GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (create/replace data), DELETE (remove data)
What are the OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories mentioned? | Broken Authentication/Access Control, Malicious File Upload, Command Injection, SQL Injection
What is Broken Authentication? | Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication functions or escalate privileges without proper authorization
What is Command Injection? | Vulnerability where attackers inject malicious commands alongside intended OS commands due to improper input sanitization
What is SQL Injection? | Vulnerability where attackers execute malicious SQL queries alongside legitimate ones due to improper input filtering
What is CVE and what does it stand for? | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - publicly shared vulnerability records with assigned scores for known security flaws
What are the CVSS v3 severity ratings? | None (0.0), Low (0.1-3.9), Medium (4.0-6.9), High (7.0-8.9), Critical (9.0-10.0)
What are the three CVSS metric groups? | Base (inherent vulnerability characteristics), Temporal (changes over time), Environmental (organizational impact)
What is Shell-Shock? | Well-known Apache web server vulnerability that affected servers released in/before 2014, allowing remote control via HTTP requests
Why should back-end component vulnerabilities be patched even if not directly exploitable? | They can be used for privilege escalation and lateral movement after gaining initial access to the server or network
