Which SQL injection type is considered the most common in web applications?|Boolean-based blind SQL injection
Which SQL injection type is considered the fastest except for UNION query-based?|Error-based SQL injection
Which SQL injection type is considered the fastest overall?|UNION query-based SQL injection
What is the principle behind Boolean-based blind SQL injection?|It exploits vulnerabilities through differentiation of TRUE from FALSE query results by comparing server responses
What is the principle behind Time-based blind SQL injection?|It uses response time as the source for differentiation between TRUE or FALSE responses
What is stacked queries also known as?|Piggy-backing
What databases support stacked queries by default?|Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL
What is Out-of-band SQL injection used for?|Cases where all other types are either unsupported by the vulnerable web application or are too slow
How does SQLMap perform Out-of-band SQL injection?|Through DNS exfiltration where requested queries are retrieved through DNS traffic
What does it mean when SQLMap says target URL content is stable?|There are no major changes between responses in case of continuous identical requests
What does it mean when a parameter appears to be dynamic?|Any changes made to its value would result in a change in the response indicating the parameter may be linked to a database
What does it indicate when SQLMap finds reflective values?|Parts of the used payloads are found in the response which could cause problems to automation tools
What is the default level value in SQLMap?|Level 1 (range 1-5)
What is the default risk value in SQLMap?|Risk 1 (range 1-3)
What does the level option control in SQLMap?|It extends both vectors and boundaries being used based on their expectancy of success
What does the risk option control in SQLMap?|It extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side
How many payloads are used by default in SQLMap?|Up to 72 payloads for testing a single parameter
How many payloads are used with maximum level and risk settings?|7,865 payloads with level 5 and risk 3
What are the two main components of SQLMap payloads?|Vector (central SQL code) and boundaries (prefix and suffix formations)
What is a vector in SQLMap terminology?|The central part of the payload carrying the useful SQL code to be executed at the target
What are boundaries in SQLMap terminology?|Prefix and suffix formations used for proper injection of the vector into the vulnerable SQL statement
Why might OR payloads be considered dangerous?|They are inherently dangerous where underlying vulnerable SQL statements are actively modifying database content
What does the parse-errors option do?|It parses DBMS errors and displays them as part of the program run
What does the traffic option do?|It stores the whole traffic content to an output file for manual investigation
What does increasing verbosity level do?|It shows more detailed output including payloads and HTTP requests/responses
What is the purpose of using a proxy with SQLMap?|To redirect all traffic through a proxy like Burp for manual investigation of requests
Which databases does SQLMap fully support for Error-based injection?|MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Vertica, IBM DB2, Firebird, MonetDB
What technique does SQLMap use before UNION payloads?|ORDER BY technique to quickly recognize the correct number of required UNION columns
What statistical model does SQLMap use for time-based injections?|A statistical model to distinguish between regular and deliberately delayed target responses
What happens when SQLMap extends UNION query injection tests?|It increases the number of requests from the default cap when there's a good chance the target is vulnerable
What does it mean when SQLMap identifies injection points?|SQLMap has successfully detected and can exploit SQLi vulnerabilities with proof of concept
Where does SQLMap store session data?|In local file system under ~/.sqlmap/output/[target] directory
What is the Copy as cURL feature used for?|To easily set up SQLMap requests by copying HTTP requests from browser developer tools
What file formats does SQLMap support for POST data?|Form-data, JSON formatted, and XML formatted HTTP requests
What is the request file option used for?|To provide SQLMap with a complete HTTP request from a file captured by tools like Burp
How can you mark a specific parameter for testing in POST data?|By using an asterisk (*) marker in the data
What is the random-agent switch used for?|To randomly select a User-Agent header value to avoid detection by protection solutions
What does the mobile switch do?|It imitates a smartphone by using appropriate header values
What advanced tuning option helps with dynamic content responses?|Using status codes, titles, strings, or text-only switches to focus detection mechanisms
What is the purpose of the technique option?|To specify which SQLi techniques to use and skip others
What does the union-cols option specify?|The exact number of columns in the vulnerable SQL query for UNION attacks
What does the union-char option do?|Specifies alternative dummy filling values instead of NULL and random integers
What does the union-from option specify?|Sets the required FROM table appendix for UNION queries, especially needed for Oracle
What is database enumeration in SQL injection context? | The process of lookup and retrieval of all available information from a vulnerable database after successful detection and confirmation of SQLi vulnerability
What are the four basic pieces of information typically retrieved first during database enumeration? | Database version banner, current user name, current database name, and checking if current user has DBA rights
What does DBA stand for and what does it represent? | Database Administrator - represents privileged user within the DBMS context with minimal constraints within the database
What is the difference between 'inband' and 'blind' queries in SQLMap's queries.xml? | Inband queries are used in non-blind situations where query results appear in the response itself, while blind queries are used when data must be retrieved row-by-row, column-by-column, and bit-by-bit
What are the main output formats supported by SQLMap for dumped data? | CSV (default), HTML, and SQLite formats
What is the purpose of conditional enumeration in database attacks? | To retrieve specific rows based on known WHERE conditions rather than dumping entire tables
What does the root database user typically represent in modern deployments? | A privileged user within the DBMS context only, with minimal OS-level privileges for security reasons
What are anti-CSRF tokens and how do they protect against automation? | Security tokens that must be present in HTTP requests to prove the user actually visited and used the page, preventing automated attacks and malicious links
What is the purpose of unique value bypass techniques? | To circumvent web applications that require unique parameter values to prevent CSRF attempts and automation tools
What is calculated parameter bypass used for? | When web applications expect parameter values to be calculated based on other parameters, often requiring message digests like MD5 hashes
What are the two main methods for IP address concealing during SQL injection attacks? | Using proxy servers or the Tor anonymity network
What is a WAF and how does SQLMap detect it? | Web Application Firewall - SQLMap detects it by sending malicious payloads with non-existent parameters and observing substantial response changes
What is user-agent blacklisting and how is it bypassed? | Web applications blocking default SQLMap user-agent strings, bypassed by using random browser user-agent values
What are tamper scripts in SQLMap? | Python scripts that modify requests before sending to target, primarily used to bypass WAF/IPS solutions by altering payload syntax
What is chunked transfer encoding used for in SQLMap? | A bypass technique that splits POST request bodies into chunks to avoid detection of blacklisted SQL keywords
What is HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)? | A technique where payloads are split between multiple same-named parameters that get concatenated by supporting platforms
What privileges are typically required for reading local files in MySQL? | LOAD DATA and INSERT privileges to load file content into tables and read them
What configuration must be disabled in MySQL to allow writing local files? | The secure-file-priv configuration must be manually disabled to allow INTO OUTFILE SQL queries
What are the three main techniques SQLMap uses for OS command execution? | Writing remote shells, creating SQL functions that execute commands, and using direct SQL queries that execute OS commands
Why might UNION technique fail for OS shell execution? | It may have limitations on retrieved entry numbers, making error-based techniques more reliable for direct output
