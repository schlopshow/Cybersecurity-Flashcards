What PHP functions are commonly vulnerable to command injection? | exec(), system(), shell_exec(), and the backtick operator
What is call_user_func_array() used for? | A PHP function that calls an existing function with an array of parameters, which can lead to command injection
What makes WordPress xmlrpc.php a security concern? | It can facilitate enumeration, brute force attacks, IP disclosure, XSPA, and DDoS attacks depending on enabled methods
What are the three main attack types possible through pingback.ping? | IP Disclosure, Cross-Site Port Attack (XSPA), and Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS)
