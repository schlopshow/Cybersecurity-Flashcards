What is SQL injection?|A vulnerability where malicious users can inject SQL code into web application queries to execute unintended database operations
What are the three main steps an attacker needs for SQL injection?|1. Inject SQL code outside expected input limits 2. Execute a different SQL query 3. Retrieve the output from the new query
What character is commonly used to escape input limits in basic SQL injection?|Single quote (') or double quote (")
What is a DBMS?|Database Management System - software that helps create, define, host, and manage databases
What are the main features of a DBMS?|Concurrency, Consistency, Security, Reliability, and Structured Query Language support
What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?|Relational databases use tables, rows, columns and schemas with SQL; Non-relational (NoSQL) databases use various storage models without fixed schemas
What does RDBMS stand for?|Relational Database Management System
What is a database schema?|The structure that defines the relationships between tables within a database
What are the four common NoSQL storage models?|Key-Value, Document-Based, Wide-Column, and Graph
What is a primary key?|A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table
What does the AUTO_INCREMENT property do?|Automatically increments a column value by one every time a new record is added
What does the NOT NULL constraint ensure?|That a particular column is never left empty - it's a required field
What does the UNIQUE constraint do?|Ensures that all values in a column are different - no duplicates allowed
What does the DEFAULT keyword specify?|The default value to use for a column if no value is provided during insertion
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?|WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY operations
What does the LIKE operator do?|Enables pattern matching in queries using wildcards like % and _
What does the % wildcard match?|Zero or more characters in a LIKE pattern
What does the _ wildcard match?|Exactly one character in a LIKE pattern
What are the three main logical operators in SQL?|AND, OR, and NOT
What is operator precedence in SQL?|The order in which operations are evaluated in complex expressions
What does ORDER BY do?|Sorts query results by specified columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order
What does LIMIT do?|Restricts the number of records returned by a query
What is the purpose of the OFFSET in LIMIT?|Specifies how many records to skip before starting to return results
What are the main SQL statement categories?|DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DCL (Data Control Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language)
What is the impact of SQL injection on web applications?|Can lead to unauthorized data access, bypassing authentication, reading/writing files, and potentially gaining server control
What are some prevention methods for SQL injection?|Input sanitization and validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, proper user privileges
What is the difference between SQL injection and NoSQL injection?|SQL injection targets relational databases using SQL; NoSQL injection targets non-relational databases with different query methods
What is a three-tier architecture in database systems?|Client applications (Tier 1), Application server/middleware (Tier 2), Database server (Tier 3)
What port does MySQL typically run on?|Port 3306
What does a table represent in a relational database?|A collection of related data organized in rows and columns
What is the purpose of data types in database columns?|Define what kind of values can be stored in each column (numbers, strings, dates, etc.)
What happens if you try to insert data longer than a VARCHAR limit?|An error occurs as the data exceeds the column's defined maximum length
What is the difference between DDL and DML?|DDL defines database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP); DML manipulates data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
What is database normalization?|The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity
What are foreign keys?|Columns that reference the primary key of another table to establish relationships
What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?|INNER JOIN returns only matching records from both tables; LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table plus matches from the right
What is a database index?|A data structure that improves query performance by creating shortcuts to data locations
What are database transactions?|A sequence of operations that are treated as a single unit of work - either all succeed or all fail
What does ACID stand for in database terms?|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - properties that guarantee reliable database transactions
What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?|CHAR has fixed length and pads with spaces; VARCHAR has variable length and uses only needed space
What are views in databases?|Virtual tables created from query results that don't store data but provide a way to present data
What is database denormalization?|The process of adding redundancy to improve query performance at the cost of storage space
What are stored procedures?|Precompiled SQL code blocks stored in the database that can be executed multiple times
What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?|Clustered indexes physically reorder table data; non-clustered indexes create separate structures pointing to data
What is a composite key?|A primary key composed of multiple columns that together uniquely identify a record
What are database triggers?|Special stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain database events
What is connection pooling?|A technique that maintains a cache of database connections to improve application performance
What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?|DELETE removes specific rows and can be rolled back; TRUNCATE removes all rows, is faster, but cannot be rolled back
