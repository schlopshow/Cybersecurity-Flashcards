What is SQL injection?|SQL injection occurs when user input is inputted into an SQL query string without properly sanitizing or filtering the input allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL code
What is sanitization in the context of SQL injection?|Sanitization refers to the removal of any special characters in user-input in order to break any injection attempts
What are the three main categories of SQL injection based on output retrieval?|In-band (Union-based and Error-based) Blind (Boolean-based and Time-based) and Out-of-band SQL injection
What is In-band SQL injection?|SQL injection where the output of both intended and injected queries may be printed directly on the front end allowing direct reading of results
What is Blind SQL injection?|SQL injection where output is not directly visible requiring the use of SQL logic to retrieve information character by character using conditional statements
What is Out-of-band SQL injection?|SQL injection where there is no direct access to output requiring directing results to a remote location like DNS records for retrieval
What SQL operator can be used to make authentication bypass conditions always return true?|The OR operator can be used because if at least one condition is TRUE the entire query evaluates to TRUE
Why does the condition '1'='1' work for SQL injection bypass?|Because 1 always equals 1 making this condition always evaluate to TRUE regardless of other conditions in the query
What are the two types of line comments available in MySQL for SQL injection?|Two dashes with a space (-- ) and the hash symbol (#)
What is the purpose of using comments in SQL injection?|Comments allow attackers to ignore or comment out parts of the original query to avoid syntax errors and control query execution
What is the UNION clause used for in SQL?|UNION is used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements allowing data extraction from multiple tables and databases
What is a key requirement for UNION statements to work?|UNION statements can only operate on SELECT statements with an equal number of columns
How do you handle uneven columns in UNION injection?|Use junk data like numbers or strings to fill remaining columns so the total number of columns matches the original query
What are two methods to detect the number of columns in a table for UNION injection?|Using ORDER BY to sort by column numbers until an error occurs or using UNION with different column numbers until success
Why is it important to determine which columns are displayed in UNION injection?|Not all columns from a query may be displayed on the webpage so injection must be placed in visible columns to see output
What happens when SQL injection causes a syntax error?|The application typically returns an error message indicating the query failed due to improper SQL syntax
What is operator precedence important in SQL injection?|The AND operator is evaluated before OR operator so understanding precedence helps craft successful injection payloads
How can parentheses affect SQL injection attempts?|Parentheses group conditions and may require closing them properly or the injection will cause syntax errors
What is Union-based SQL injection?|A type of in-band SQL injection that uses the UNION operator to combine malicious queries with legitimate ones to extract data
What is Error-based SQL injection?|A type of in-band SQL injection that intentionally causes SQL errors to return information about the database structure or data
