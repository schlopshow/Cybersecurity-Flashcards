I need to make flashcards from this text, it will bve question and answer delimited by a pipe symbol | don't put any headers, just give me the question | answer. Put it in csv format so I can copy easier. Please don't put any commands in the cards, I only want important information, memorizing commands is not as concepts.

at the very end, if you like you can make a cheat sheat of commands from the text provided.

Please delimit using a pipe |

put the cheatsheat in a markdown file.
